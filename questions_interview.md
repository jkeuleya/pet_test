# 1. How would you integrate a payment gateway into a Rails backend? Describe steps or tools you use.

Well, I've primarily worked with Stripe in production environments, so I'll walk you through that approach, though the principles apply to most payment gateways.

First, I start with the stripe-ruby gem: it's well-maintained and provides a clean API wrapper. After adding it to the Gemfile, I set up the configuration in an initializer with the API keys stored securely in Rails credentials or environment variables.

For the architecture, I typically create a dedicated PaymentsController and extract the payment logic into service objects. This keeps the controllers thin and makes the payment flow testable. I usually have services like PaymentProcessor and SubscriptionManager depending on the use case.

The basic flow I implement is: create a payment intent on the backend, send the client secret to the frontend, handle the confirmation client-side with Stripe Elements, then process the webhook for the final status update. This approach gives you better security since sensitive operations stay server-side.

Webhooks are crucial: I always implement proper webhook handling with signature verification. Stripe sends events like payment_intent.succeeded or invoice.payment_failed, and you need to handle these idempotently since webhooks can be delivered multiple times.

For error handling, I wrap Stripe calls in begin-rescue blocks to catch Stripe::CardError, Stripe::InvalidRequestError, etc., and return appropriate JSON responses to the frontend.

I also implement proper logging and monitoring, payment failures need immediate attention, so I use tools like Sentry for error tracking and set up alerts for failed payments.

One thing I learned from experience is to always test with Stripe's test mode thoroughly, they provide test card numbers for different scenarios like declined cards, expired cards, and 3D Secure authentication.

For subscriptions, I handle the complexity of proration, plan changes, and failed payment retries through Stripe's built-in features combined with custom business logic in service objects.

The key is keeping payment logic isolated, well-tested, and always assuming network calls can fail.

# 2. Have you worked with any frontend technologies (React, Vue.js, etc.) integrated with backend systems?

I'm primarily a backend developer, but I have encountered frontend technologies several times throughout my career.

With React, I've had to work on it in different projects where I needed to build components or modify existing ones. I'm comfortable with the basics: creating functional components, using hooks like useState and useEffect, handling props, and making API calls to connect with the Rails backends I build. I've created forms, data display components, and handled basic state management, but nothing overly complex like advanced state management with Redux or complex routing.

I also worked with React Native on a mobile project where I had to develop some components alongside the backend API work. It was interesting to see how React concepts translate to mobile development.

The thing is, while I can work with these technologies when needed, my real expertise and passion is on the backend side. I'm much more comfortable architecting Rails applications, optimizing database queries, designing APIs, and handling complex business logic.

When I do frontend work, it's usually in the context of making sure the backend integrates well with what the frontend needs. I understand how to structure API responses that are frontend-friendly and I can debug integration issues between the two layers.

So I'd say I'm competent enough to contribute on the frontend when necessary, but I'm definitely most valuable focusing on backend development where I can really add significant value to the team.

# 3. Have you worked with third-party SDKs/APIs like PubNub, SendGrid, or similar? Please list what you’ve integrated

Yes, I’ve worked with a wide range of third-party APIs and SDKs throughout my career—integrating them into both production-critical and internal tooling systems.

One of the most notable integrations I’ve worked on is Stripe, where I implemented full payment workflows, including one-time and recurring payments, webhook handling, and fraud protection logic. I’ve also worked with email providers like SendGrid and Mailjet, integrating transactional email flows, dynamic templates, and event-based triggers (e.g. status updates, onboarding sequences, alerting).

Beyond that, I’ve integrated cloud provider SDKs and APIs extensively—especially AWS (S3, SES, SNS, Lambda) and GCP (Cloud Storage, Pub/Sub)—for everything from file uploads and background processing to notification systems.

I’ve also worked with:

- Monitoring & alerting APIs like New Relic and Datadog

- Document parsing APIs for OCR and PDF manipulation

- Background processing queues and Pub/Sub architectures

- AI APIs such as OpenAI’s GPT for internal assistants and smart suggestions

- File processing services, including image optimization and media conversion APIs

To be honest, over the years I’ve probably integrated dozens of APIs—many of which I’ve forgotten the names of—but I’m very comfortable diving into a new SDK, reading the docs, setting up secure credentials, and quickly wiring up a reliable and testable integration.
